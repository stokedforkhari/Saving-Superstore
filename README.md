# Saving SuperStore: Profitability & Performance Analysis

In this Tableau project, I was tasked with identifying key opportunities to improve profitability and operational efficiency for a struggling retail company, "SuperStore." The analysis was divided into three strategic areas:

üîç Part 1: Profits & Losses
I analyzed combinations of dimensions (e.g., Sub-Category + Region, Shipping Mode + Product ID) to pinpoint the top profit drivers and major loss-makers. Using comparative bar charts and heat maps, I identified underperforming products and subcategories that should be phased out, as well as high-margin areas for the business to prioritize.

üì¢ Part 2: Advertising Strategy
To evaluate the value of targeted advertising, I examined average monthly profits across all states. I recommended the top 3 state-month combinations for ad investment, calculating a return on ad spend (ROAS) to determine a cost-effective budget. This allowed for data-driven decisions on when and where to advertise.

üì¶ Part 3: Returns Analysis
I performed a LEFT JOIN between the Returns and Orders tables and created a calculated field to quantify return rates. Visualizations were used to highlight the products and customers with the highest return rates. Additionally, I mapped average profit against return rate across various dimensions to provide actionable insights on where the store should reconsider or double down on operations.

This project demonstrates my ability to uncover actionable business insights using Tableau, perform calculated field transformations, and communicate findings through compelling visual narratives.
